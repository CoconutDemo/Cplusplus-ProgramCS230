# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is the client. They created their game "Draw It or Lose it". The game is about teams competing against each other and there are rounds where both teams have a chance to guess what the images are. Each game has four rounds with a time limit of one minute each. They want to expand their game and it's software by making it web-based which will serve multiple platforms. It is currently available on the Android App, and they are requesting us to expand their software.
