# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is the client. They created their game "Draw It or Lose it". The game is about teams competing against each other and there are rounds where both teams have a chance to guess what the images are. Each game has four rounds with a time limit of one minute each. They want to expand their game and it's software by making it web-based which will serve multiple platforms. It is currently available on the Android App, and they are requesting us to expand their software.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What I feel like I did well is towards the end of the template, with the recommendation sections. I thoroughly considered through my research and found ideal operating systems that could benefit this game's software and the developers request of expanding their platforms.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
While developing this code and looking through the clients requirements, it helped me learn more about singleton and iterator patterns and how it can be effective in applications such as this. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One of the sections I would like to improve on or revise would be the design constraints. I feel like there would be more to add on or consider. For example, I should have added budget being a design constraint. Although the client's game was successful on Android. I feel like it wasn't something that the game, struck gold. They are still developing their game and now since they're considering expanding platforms we should be wary on the amount of funds to spend and where to spend it on. This is something I would've added onto the document.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is important to consider the user's needs when designing any software design. For one as a developer, we need to be considerate on the user's needs and then work on towards what they are ideally looking for on their software. When I learned the constraints or requirements from the client such as unique names/id's in games or teams. I implemented the iterator and singlton pattern and then deployed into the coding which fulfilled the user's need into the software design.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approaches initially was to observe the client's needs and then go off from there into creating the software. We need to address the client's needs and make sure to implement the feature into the software. The techniques I would use for future or similar software applications would be the use of singleton patterns and iterator patterns. I could use this for other features not just only game id/s or teams this could be used for many other things so it can prevent spam or waste storage which would heavily affect the application processes.
